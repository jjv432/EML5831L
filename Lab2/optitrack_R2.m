    REVISIONS:
    
    Fixed issue in previous revision that could not assign more than one 
    rigid body's data at a time.

    Has been tested and works with: three rigid bodies with three markers;
    one rigid body with four markers; and one rigid body with four markers
    and two rigid bodies with three markers.
    
    Added some error checking to marker quality

    Added save and normalize 'features'.

%% Setup


%These are the types of rotation that can be associated with a pivot point
RotationNames = ["RotationY", "RotationX", "RotationZ"]; 

%Markers are assigned X, Y, Z, or MQ (Marker Quality) in the .csv
MarkerNames = ["X", "Y", "Z", "MQ"];

%% General User Input (SKIP)

%Calling user's .csv.  Must be in same folder
FileNamePlain = input("Enter the filename (without extension): ", "s");
FileName = strcat(FileNamePlain, '.csv');

%Information about the experiment
MarkerCount = input("Enter the total number of markers used (int): "); %TOTAL Number of markers used in the test
RigidBodyCount = input("Enter the number of rigid bodies created (int): "); %Number of rigid bodies


%ColRange sets the bounds of the data.  This avoids reading 'unlabeled' markers
%from the CSV.

ColRange = 2 + 7*RigidBodyCount + 4*MarkerCount + 3*MarkerCount; 

%2 for time and index, then 7 for the pivot point data (RotX, RotY, RotZ, X, Y, Z, MME), 
% then 4 for raw data (X, Y, Z, MQ), then 3 for interpolated data (X, Y, Z)


%% Retrieving Rigid Body Names

%Reading the data as a string so the names of rigid bodies can be checked

RigidNames = readmatrix(FileName, 'OutputType', 'string', 'Delimiter', ','); 


%RowHelp is a variable that shifts the row that rigid body names are read
%from in RigidNames.  This is a seemingly random formatting change.
RowHelp = 0;

%Checking for this 'random' error
if RigidNames(1) == "Format Version"
    RowHelp = 1;
end

%RigidNames will be used to assign data for the pivot point.  Notice the
%order of the names in the first half of the data are the order the bodies
%were exported, whereas the interpolated data is alphabatized.

%Reducing to name row only (Skips first two (or three) rows)
RigidNames = RigidNames(2+RowHelp, :); 

fileID = fopen(FileName, 'r');
for a = 1:(4+RowHelp) %Had to change from 2 before?
    RigidNames = fgetl(fileID);
end
RigidNames = string(strsplit(RigidNames, ','));
fclose(fileID);
%Removing repeats, this leaves only the rigid body names in the CSV.
%Must use 'stable' to avoid alphabatizing


%Removing formatting from RigidNames so they work as struct fields
%Also removing "Unlabeled" markers (noise/interference)
for i=1:numel(RigidNames)
    RigidNames(i) = erase(RigidNames(i), ":"); %Avoid problems with struct naming convention (Can't contain : in a field)
    RigidNames(i) = erase(RigidNames(i), "..."); %Avoid problems with struct naming convention (Can't contain ... in a field)
    RigidNames(i) = erase(RigidNames(i), "'"); %Avoid problems with struct naming convention (Can't contain ... in a field)
    RigidNames(i) = erase(RigidNames(i), '"'); %Avoid problems with struct naming convention (Can't contain ... in a field)
    if (contains(RigidNames(i), "Unlabeled") || contains(RigidNames(i), "Name"))
        RigidNames(i) = "Zero";
    end
end


LengthTemp = 0;

RigidNames(find(RigidNames == "")) = [];


%Removing Zeros created above
RigidNames(RigidNames=="Zero") = []; %Removing and resizing unlabed (interference) data points
RigidNames = rmmissing(RigidNames); %Removing 'missing' from array 

RigidNames = unique(RigidNames, 'stable');

%RigidNames now only contains the names of the rigid bodies in the user's
%csv.

%% Marker and Time Data

%Only reading marker data what is within ColRange
TakeData = readmatrix(FileName, 'Range', 'A8'); 
TakeData = TakeData(:,1:ColRange); 

%Time (in seconds)
Time = TakeData(:,2);
UserRigidP.Time = Time; %Adding Time to the struct


%% Pivot Point Data (X, Y, Z, ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ, MQ)

%{
    'Section' refers to how many unique names are associated with the rigid 
     body. Each will have one for the rigid body, and then one for each 
     marker on the body.  So, a body with 4 markers with have 5 sections.
